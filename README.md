# TCGStoreHomePage
Built a home page about a Trading Card Game store called MudkipTCG where they specialize in selling Pokemon cards. This site was made for practice in my web development
training at a bootcamp online. It consists of only HTML and CSS, however this a work in progress as I do plan on editing and expanding it with other pages linked to it and
add features from other languages that are required to make it work.
